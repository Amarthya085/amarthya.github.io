# Aspiring ML Engineer/AI Engineer/Software Development Ebgineer

## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Amarthya Kathula, a Computer Science Masterâ€™s student at ASU with a passion for deploying machine learning models, especially in computer vision, and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (mLLMs). I love turning data into intelligent systems and bringing AI from research to real-world applications. Iâ€™m also interested in optimizing AI models for lightweight and mobile-friendly deployment, ensuring they run efficiently even on resource-constrained devices. Beyond AI, I enjoy software development and staying on top of the latest tech trendsâ€”because letâ€™s be honest, in this field, if you blink, you might miss a new framework release.

When Iâ€™m not optimizing models or writing code, I lead an active life, whether that means connecting with people, learning from experts, or debugging for hours before realizing the issue was a missing semicolon. I believe in continuous learning, surrounding myself with knowledgeable people, and improving every dayâ€”both in tech and in life.

P.S. Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Software Development. If you're hiringâ€”or just want to chat about AIâ€”feel free to reach out! ðŸš€
